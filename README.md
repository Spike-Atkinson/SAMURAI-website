# SAMURAI-website
The HTML, PHP and design document submissions for my CE154 Web Development module. 

The 'Report.pdf' shows the design process via wireframes, user stories, and references.

The HTML version of the website should run in your browser without issue. Just download that folder and open 'index.html'.

The PHP version of the website has the framework for a working basket/checkout/login etc. but will requires that you host the site on a server using something like tomcat. The university hosted my database and I no longer have access to it, so you would also need to make an empty database with the following fields:
  "ID", "name", "description", "type", "published", "img", with the correct datatypes, which I no longer remember. Probably primary ID, string, string, string, date, probably a path to respective image files.

But I doubt anyone will go to those lengths, so the main reason I uploaded the PHP version is to show that I did it, by being able to review the code.
